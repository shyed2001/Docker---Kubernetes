Docker Installation:
go to-
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
or
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-engine---community-1

Check Prerequisites .

Uninstall old versions
Older versions of Docker were called docker, docker.io , or docker-engine. If these are installed, uninstall them:

$ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

It’s OK if apt-get reports that none of these packages are installed.


Install by-

Install using the convenience script

Docker provides convenience scripts at get.docker.com and test.docker.com for installing edge and testing versions of Docker Engine - Community into development environments quickly and non-interactively. The source code for the scripts is in the docker-install repository. Using these scripts is not recommended for production environments, and you should understand the potential risks before you use them:

The scripts require root or sudo privileges to run. Therefore, you should carefully examine and audit the scripts before running them.
The scripts attempt to detect your Linux distribution and version and configure your package management system for you. In addition, 
the scripts do not allow you to customize any installation parameters. This may lead to an unsupported configuration, either from Docker’s point 
of view or from your own organization’s guidelines and standards.
The scripts install all dependencies and recommendations of the package manager without asking for confirmation. This may install a large number
 of packages, depending on the current configuration of your host machine.
The script does not provide options to specify which version of Docker to install, and installs the latest version that is released in the “edge”
 channel.
Do not use the convenience script if Docker has already been installed on the host machine using another mechanism.
This example uses the script at get.docker.com to install the latest release of Docker Engine - Community on Linux. To install the latest testing
 version, use test.docker.com instead. In each of the commands below, replace each occurrence of get with test.

Warning: Always examine scripts downloaded from the internet before running them locally.

$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
$ sudo sh get-docker.sh

<output truncated>
If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider adding your user to the “docker” group with something like:

  sudo usermod -aG docker your-user
Remember to log out and back in for this to take effect!

test by 
$ sudo docker run docker/whalesay cowsay "Hellow World"
